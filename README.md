This is a readme for home server.
Just clone the repo locally on your PC and open the cloned folder in your VS Code.
Go to terminal and install required modules (like npm, typescript, express)
Change the location url(s) (like '/home/royal_rebellion/Workspace/homeserver/uploads/' in my project) to your preferred ones (in this case the locations shall be pointing to your system folders)
Now convert the typescript file into JS file and run the JS file locally in your localhost.
The good thing is that now your server is up on your machine on your local IP (something like 192.168.x.x:3000).
All files that you wish to share bw devices can be uploaded to this address.

Note : In case you find an issue try to connect devices to same wifi/internet.
